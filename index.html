        <h3 class="secheading">The Beginning</h3>
        I was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, England but didn't stay long.  Dad got a job in NZ and we came here when I was 6 months old.
        First to Porirua then to north of Upper Hutt.  Three houses down the same street in the middle of nowhere.
        Great growing up and the bush and stream were my backyard.

        <h3 class="secheading">Young</h3>
        Schooling was first at Brown Owl school (now closed), then Plateau School when it opened.  It was about 1km away so an easy walk, even for small legs.
        Intermediate was at Maidstone Intermediate which was a bus ride away.  A pain if you missed the bus as then you had to get someone to take you.

        <h3 class="secheading">High School</h3>
        There was two colleges in Upper Hutt and for years they alternated which was best (due to staffing I guess).
        When I started, Upper Hutt College was 'best' and I had to take Latin and Music to go there due to the school zoning system.
        Never liked languages and seemed to always be answering the French teacher in Latin and the Latin teacher in French.
        Finished with an A bursary. As one teacher said "You'll never get a scholarship if you don't try."  Playing 500 was more fun than working.
        Still managed to come third in seventh form.

        <h3 class="secheading">University</h3>
        I spent one year at Victoria University in Wellington then two at Otago University in Dunedin earning a BSc in Zoology and Microbiology.
        There was a real difference in departments depending on how they were funded.  The Medical School got lots of bequests and so could aford things like multi-lead electronic recorders.
        In the Zoology Department we were using smoked drum recorders (the Medical School ones were placed in their museum).

        <h3 class="secheading">Jobs</h3>
        My first job out of University was as a laboratory technician with MAF (Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) testing for Brucellosis and Leptospirosis.
        They then purchased an Apple ][ computer which sat on the shelf in the wrapping.  I was interested so spent time after work on it.
        Eventually I was spending all my time on that (and subsequest computers).
        From there it was into computing full time.  DOS 3, Windows 3 then 3.1 then 3.11.  Corvus networking, then NetWare, VMWare and Windows.
        I ended up working in network security and interoperability.  Lots of fun as well as work.
